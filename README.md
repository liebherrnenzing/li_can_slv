# li_can_slv

The Liebherr CAN protocol describes the communication of a distributed control system via CAN bus. It is designed to allow synchronous, deterministic real-time networking based on a master-slave system, whereby all input and output modules are connected with a master via CAN bus. This repository includes a slave implementation of the Liebherr CAN protocol.

Some more information is coming soon...
