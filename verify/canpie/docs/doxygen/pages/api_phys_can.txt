** \page page.api_phys_can    Physical CAN interface

A target system may have more than one physical CAN interface. The
physical CAN interfaces are numbered from 0 .. N-1 (N: total number of
physical CAN interfaces on the target system). The header file canpie.h
provides an enumeration for the physical CAN interface (the first CAN
interface is #eCP_CHANNEL_1). A physical CAN interface is opened via
the function CpCoreDriverInit(). The function will setup a pointer
to the structure CpPort_ts for further operations. The elements of the
structure CpPort_ts depend on the used target system and are defined
in the header file cp_platform.h.

<p>

For an embedded application with only one physical CAN interface the
parameter to the CAN port can be omitted. This reduces the code size
and also increases execution speed. This option is configured via the
symbol #CP_SMALL_CODE during the compilation process.
