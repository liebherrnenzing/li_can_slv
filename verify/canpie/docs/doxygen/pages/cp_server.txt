<h2>How to build</h2>

A common project file for the server, the plug-ins and the command line tools is located 
inside the directory \c source/application. The project file \c applications.pro
can be opened and compiled within the Qt Creator or via the shell:

    cd source/application
    qmake applications.pro
    make release
    

After successful compilation all executable programs are located inside the \c bin directory 
of your local %CANpie FD repository.
